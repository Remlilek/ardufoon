* Folder names from 01 to 10

  Easy to unlock though
* Add 10 files to each folder 001.mp3 to 010.mp3
* Don't forget the folder '99' !
* Change volume with pushbutton 
* Play a song by dialing a number
* Play a song by dialing folder number first and then songnumber within a few seconds

Have fun !
